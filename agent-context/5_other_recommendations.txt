when asked to analyze a netcdf, inspect it. If asked to read a netcdf time variable in matlab, inspect the variable in the netcdf and be sure time units attribute is present in the file. Mind the calendar attribute as well, some projection data are in fancy calendars such as no-leap or 360-day, which can create confusion. Once you know all the attributes provide the right command to read the time in matlab.


In coastal engineering ususally runup = setup + swash component, while Total Water Level twl = water level + runup
